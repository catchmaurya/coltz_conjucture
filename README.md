# üßÆ A Structured Approach to the Collatz Conjecture

This repository presents a mathematical and computational framework aimed at exploring and potentially reducing the scope of the Collatz Conjecture using algebraic modeling, dynamic programming, and reverse-path analysis.

## üìò Abstract

The Collatz Conjecture posits that for any positive integer `n`, repeated application of the rule:

T(n) = n / 2 if n is even
T(n) = 3n + 1 if n is odd


will eventually reach the value 1. Despite its simplicity, no general proof exists.

In this work, we:
- Represent Collatz transformations algebraically
- Use backward path construction (`T‚Åª¬π(n)`) to analyze convergence
- Implement dynamic programming to prove the conjecture over bounded domains
- Propose a recursive block-reduction model to generalize toward infinity

## üß† Key Concepts

- **Symbolic Equation Tracking**: Rewriting full paths using algebraic chains.
- **Reverse Tree Modeling**: Constructing `T‚Åª¬π(n)` as a tree rooted at 1.
- **Memoization**: Caching known paths to avoid recomputation.
- **Recursive Proof Strategy**: Showing that if `[1, N]` is proven, ranges like `[N+1, 3N+1]` follow naturally.
